   - Create Google Drive connection interface
   - Implement connection status monitoring
   - Add token management and disconnection options

2. **Export Enhancement**
   - Extend existing export functionality
   - Add Google Drive destination options
   - Implement progress tracking for uploads
   - Create organized folder structures in Drive

### Security Implementation
1. **Token Management**
   - Use secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage
   - Implement automatic token refresh
   - Add token revocation on logout/disconnect
   - Set appropriate token expiration times (1-24 hours)

2. **Scope Minimization**
   - Use `drive.file` scope (per-file access only)
   - Avoid broad Drive access permissions
   - Implement just-in-time permission requests

3. **Client-Side Security**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Use secure communication protocols

## Phase 3: Security Risks & Mitigation

### Major Security Risks Identified

1. **OAuth Token Compromise**
   - **Risk**: Tokens could be intercepted or stolen
   - **Mitigation**: Server-side token handling, encryption at rest, short expiration times

2. **Domain Takeover Vulnerability**
   - **Risk**: Google's 2024 vulnerability affecting expired domains
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain domain ownership, monitor domain expiration, use verified domains only

3. **Client-Side Exposure**
   - **Risk**: Sensitive data exposed in browser environment
   - **Mitigation**: Proxy all sensitive operations through backend, never store secrets client-side

4. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Over-requesting permissions leading to data exposure
   - **Mitigation**: Use minimal scopes, implement per-file access only

5. **Third-Party App Risks**
   - **Risk**: Users granting excessive permissions to your app
   - **Mitigation**: Clear permission explanations, easy revocation process, audit trails

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Encourage users to enable 2FA on Google accounts
   - Implement additional verification for sensitive operations
   - Add security warnings for accounts without 2FA

2. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Log all Google Drive API operations
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Implement automated security alerts
   - Regular security audits and token rotation

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt exported data before upload
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add user data deletion capabilities
   - Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance

## OAuth 2.0 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities (2024)

### Recent Major Vulnerabilities

#### Domain Takeover Vulnerability
- Millions of Americans are vulnerable due to a deficiency in Google's "Sign in with Google" flow
- Google's OAuth login doesn't protect against domain takeovers of failed startup domains
- Attackers can purchase expired domains and recreate email accounts for former employees
- Google awarded a $1,337 bounty for this vulnerability as of December 19, 2024

#### OAuth Token Compromise
- Former employees can retain access to corporate resources through copied OAuth tokens
- Attackers can copy OAuth tokens to endpoints they control to impersonate legitimate identities
- Tokens can continue working even after access is supposedly revoked

### Implementation Security Risks

1. **Specification Weaknesses**
   - OAuth specification is vague and flexible by design
   - Many optional components with no built-in security features
   - Security relies entirely on developers using correct configuration options

2. **Token Management Risks**
   - Tokens can be accidentally logged in URI parameters
   - Limited token lifetimes require careful refresh token handling
   - Client-side token exposure in JavaScript environments

3. **Session Management**
   - Compromised tokens can be exploited for extended periods
   - Default session lengths may be too long for security

### Security Best Practices for 2024

1. **Use OAuth Libraries**
   - Google strongly recommends using well-debugged OAuth 2.0 libraries
   - Avoid custom OAuth implementations due to security complexity

2. **Secure Token Handling**
   - Never transmit tokens in plaintext
   - Store encrypted tokens at rest
   - Revoke tokens when access is no longer needed
   - Set session lengths between 1-24 hours

3. **Client Credential Protection**
   - Treat OAuth client credentials like passwords
   - Use secret managers (Google Cloud Secret Manager)
   - Never commit credentials to code repositories
   - Provide whitelisted callback URIs

4. **Enterprise Controls**
   - Enable two-factor authentication (only 15% of users have it enabled)
   - Configure Chrome Enterprise Premium policies
   - Implement access levels that evaluate every API request
   - Reject requests from compromised credentials

## User Security Risks

### For End Users
1. **Account Compromise**
   - OAuth tokens can provide persistent access to Google Drive
   - Malicious apps can access more data than intended
   - Third-party apps introduce additional security vectors
