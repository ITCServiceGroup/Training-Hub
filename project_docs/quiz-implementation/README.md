# Quiz Implementation Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the quiz component implementation of the Training Hub application. The documentation is designed to assist developers in understanding the architecture, components, and implementation details of the quiz system.

## Documentation Files

- [**Implementation Summary**](./implementation-summary.md) - High-level summary of the implementation plan
- [**Quiz Implementation Overview**](./quiz-implementation-overview.md) - Architecture and implementation phases
- [**Quiz Database Schema**](./quiz-database-schema.md) - Database tables, modifications, and relationships
- [**Quiz Components (Part 1)**](./quiz-components.md) - UI components and their relationships
- [**Quiz Components (Part 2)**](./quiz-components-part2.md) - Continuation of UI components documentation
- [**Quiz Services**](./quiz-services.md) - API services and data flow
- [**Quiz Features**](./quiz-features.md) - Detailed implementation of specific features

## Key Requirements

The quiz component must:

1. Mirror the study guide section's structure (sections and categories)
2. Allow administrators to create quizzes with different question types
3. Support access code generation for restricted quizzes
4. Provide a quiz taking experience with timer, navigation, and review
5. Offer a practice quiz mode with immediate feedback
6. Save quiz results for analysis and reporting
7. Be built in a modular way to allow for future expansion

## Getting Started

If you're new to this documentation, we recommend starting with the [Implementation Summary](./implementation-summary.md) to get a high-level overview of the implementation plan. Then, you can dive deeper into specific aspects of the implementation by reading the relevant documentation files.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Core Structure** - Implement shared section/category structure
2. **Quiz Builder** - Implement quiz builder functionality
3. **Quiz Taking** - Implement quiz taking experience
4. **Access Codes** - Implement access code system
5. **Practice Quiz** - Implement practice quiz mode
6. **Results & Refinement** - Enhance results display and polish UI

## Technical Stack

The implementation uses the existing technical stack of the Training Hub application:

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication, Database, Storage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

## Contributing

When contributing to the quiz implementation, please follow these guidelines:

1. Review the documentation to understand the architecture and design decisions
2. Follow the existing patterns and coding standards
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit pull requests for review

## Questions and Support

If you have questions about the quiz implementation, please refer to the documentation first. If you can't find the answer, contact the project maintainers.
