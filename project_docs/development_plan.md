## Development Principles
1. **Authentication First**: Ensure admin authentication is solid before building features
2. **Incremental Development**: Build and test features in small, manageable chunks
3. **Simplicity**: Keep implementation as simple as possible while meeting requirements
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, then add more advanced features
